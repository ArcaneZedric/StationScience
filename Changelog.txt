2.6.1
	Thanks to github user @Carnildo for these:
		Remove broken 'Starved' display logic. As a side effect, fixes incorrect 'Running' status display and permits the display of the 'Idle', 'Stored', and 'BadLocation' statuses.
		Only show the 'Can't perform experiment' message if the experiment is running. Eliminates message spam during launch.
		Prevent an NRE if StationExperiment.CheckBoring() is called before StationExperiment.OnStart(). This can happen because CheckBoring() is called from StationScienceModule.PreProcessing()
