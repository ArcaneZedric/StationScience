	{
		default = You note the characteristics of the fuel.
		
		KerbinSrfLanded = The fuel seems much the same as it always does.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = Looking at the fuel sloshing around is making you seasick. No, wait, that's the ocean.
		KerbinInSpace = Tiny impulses in the absence of strong gravity send the fuel swirling around the tank.
		MunInSpace = The fuel is less dense up here.
		MunSrfLanded = Tiny particles of Mun dust seem to have contaminated the tank. Did someone leave the safety valve open?
		MinmusInSpace = The surface below is making you hungry, so you decide to taste some of the fuel. Hmm. Do we have medical kits somewhere?
		MinmusSrfLanded = The swirling of the fuel reminds you of ice cream.
		SunInSpace = Unfortunately, staring at the rocket fuel doesn't make time pass any quicker out here.
		
		MohoSrfLanded = The fuel seems to be sublimating inside the tank.
		MohoInSpace = The fuel can't make up its mind whether to be hot or cold.
		EveSrfLanded = The intense pressure makes the fuel leak out a small crack in the side of the tank. 
		EveSrfSplashed = The tank floats - it seems that the ocean is denser than rocket fuel.
		EveInSpace = The purple tint of the planet below seems to have no effect on the fuel whatsoever. You're not sure why you thought it would.
		//GillySrfLanded = 
		//GillyInSpace = 
		DunaSrfLanded = There's enough air pressure here to make the fuel a bit frisky.
		DunaInSpace = Is that water in the tank? Oh wait no, it's just a trick of the light.
		//IkeSrfLanded = 
		//IkeInSpace = 
		//DresSrfLanded = 
		//DresInSpace = 
		JoolSrfLanded = The fuel escapes. You really should do the same.
		JoolInSpace = The fuel separates into layers to match the bands of clouds below.
		LaytheSrfLanded = You scoop some extra "oxidizer" into the tank when no-one's looking.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = At this temperature, the fuel seems to take up more room than the chilled stuff. Maybe you could pack more into the same space if it was even colder?

		EelooSrfLanded = It's easier to keep the fuel and oxidiser at the right relative densities out here. Maybe something to do with the cold?
		EelooInSpace = The fuel freezes into impressive crystal lattices.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = You note the explosive characteristics of the fuel.
		
		KerbinSrfLanded = The scorch marks on the side of the tank remind you of the launch pad.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = You know how they say water and oil don't mix? Looks like it's true for water and rocket fuel, too.
		KerbinInSpace = In orbit, no-one can hear your fuel tanks rupturing explosively.
		MunInSpace = Sparking to life, the fuel burns bright and hot. This doesn't tell us much, but sure does look pretty.
		MunSrfLanded = The fuel suddenly ignites, and you only narrowly avoid creating a new crater.
		MinmusInSpace = The low gravity means the fuel is drifting in mesmerising patterns, chased by small flames.
		MinmusSrfLanded = As it burns, the fuel gives off a minty odour. How strange.
		SunInSpace = The solar radiation seems to have increased the volatility of the fuel. The increased temperature means you should probably be carefu-%^^aSts@4z_jZMu
		
		MohoSrfLanded = For the sake of the fuel, you'd better have landed in a shadow...
		MohoInSpace = There are some weird readings coming from the tank. Seems like solar radiation has altered some of the fuel. Cool!
		EveSrfLanded = The high pressure means we can store more fuel in the tank!
		EveSrfSplashed = A bit of ocean seeps into the tank, increasing the explosive potential of the fuel. This is not good.
		EveInSpace = If you dumped the fuel out and set it alight, would it set Eve's atmosphere on fire?
		//GillySrfLanded = 
		//GillyInSpace = 
		DunaSrfLanded = There's a lot more redness than usual in the flaming mess inside the fuel tank.
		DunaInSpace = Tiny fireballs form in the tank, and rapidly consume the rest of the fuel.
		//IkeSrfLanded = 
		//IkeInSpace = 
		//DresSrfLanded = 
		//DresInSpace = 
		JoolSrfLanded = The fuel starter ignites the atmosphere around you. You should probably not be here.
		JoolInSpace = The fuel seems remarkably well-behaved out here.
		LaytheSrfLanded = The oxygen in the atmosphere makes the fuel burn much hotter.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = With this much water around, it's hard to get a conclusive reading.

		//VallSrfLanded =

		EelooSrfLanded = The fuel is far too cold to explode.
		EelooInSpace = It's dark out here. So is the fuel.

		KerbinInSpace = The plasma seems about the same here as it does back in the lab.
		MunInSpace = The plasma swirls in a perfectly circular fashion.
		MinmusInSpace = The plasma glows a minty green colour.
		SunInSpace = A solar flare leaves you with more plasma than you started with! The Kuarqs quickly degenerate it, though.
		
		MohoInSpace = The high speed of Moho's orbit pulls the plasma into a vortex.
		EveInSpace = The plasma seems right at home here.
		GillyInSpace = The plasma dissipates in the extremely weak gravity of Gilly.
		DunaInSpace = Duna's weak magnetic field doesn't seem to bother the plasma at all.
		IkeInSpace = The plasma is as featureless and unmarked as the surface below.
		DresInSpace = The plasma briefly spells out the word "POTATO".
		JoolInSpace = The intense magnetic field around Jool is pulling the plasma into thin streams.
		LaytheInSpace = The plasma swirls and flows like water.
		VallInSpace = Formations that look like ice crystals appear in the plasma.
		TyloInSpace = Bright reflections from Tylo cause white streaks to form in the plasma.
		BopInSpace = The plasma is as irregular as the surface below.
		PolInSpace = Dense clumps form in the plasma. Is that pollen?
		EelooInSpace = The plasma hums quietly to itself. It seems to like the quiet out here.
